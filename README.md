# Project Overview

This project builds a test suite for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Besides the tests specified in the project rubric, several more tests were added for "future features". Some of the new features have been implemented, others were purposely allowed to fail. The list of additional tests is provided below.

# Future Features

- Header background color changes when new feed is loaded (FAILS)

- Menu icon changes when menu is shown, changes back when menu is hidden (FAILS)

- Header has "Clip" button that toggles "Read Later" menu (PASS)

- Feed entries have a "Read Later" option that when clicked add that link to the "Read Later" list (PASS)

- Same entry can't be added to "Read Later" list twice (FAILS)
